# Quantum-Notebook
This is the repository of a the Womanium Quantum Global Project of Pietro Garofalo and Jasmine Murphy.
It is an open-source notebook to compile our notes taken throughout the program and share them so others around the world can also learn about these topics.
We believe that knowledge should be free and accessible to all so we decided to share our notes taken during the program with all those who want to have support while studying or are simply curious about the field of Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computing.
We also decided not only to share the PDF file but we want to give the opportunity to be able to contribute to the creation of the work itself : therefore, anyone can add chapters, edit existing ones or simply correct any errors. 
We want to see others contribute to the notes over time with their own quantum topics!

# How to use and how to contribute to the project
If you are only interested in reading the document you can safely download the PDF file directly from Github.
On the other hand, if you want to contribute to the document, just clone the repository and then push your changes.
In case you want to write a whole chapter please respect the organization of the original file : each chapter has its own folder with the .tex file and any images inside ( don't forget to add the .tex file to the main ), if instead you want to modify something already existing please explain fully why you want to modify it and attach any sources.


Currently the project is hosted here on Overleaf: https://www.overleaf.com/project/64afaf8fcb842131539d2350
