# Quantum-Notebook
This is the repository of a the Womanium Quantum Global Project of Pietro Garofalo and Jasmine Murphy.
It is an open-source notebook to compile our notes taken throughout the program and share them so others around the world can also learn about these topics.
We believe that knowledge should be free and accessible to all so we decided to share our notes taken during the program with all those who want to have support while studying or are simply curious about the field of Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computing.
We also decided not only to share the PDF file but we want to give the opportunity to be able to contribute to the creation of the work itself : therefore, anyone can add chapters, edit existing ones or simply correct any errors. 
We want to see others contribute to the notes over time with their own quantum topics!

Currently the project is hosted here on Overleaf: https://www.overleaf.com/project/64afaf8fcb842131539d2350
