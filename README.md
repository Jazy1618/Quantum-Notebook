# Quantum-Notebook
This is the repository of a the Womanium Quantum Global Project of Pietro Garofalo and Jasmine Murphy. It is an open-source notebook to compile our notes taken throughout the program and share them so others around the world can also learn about these topics. We want to see others contribute to the notes over time with their own quantum topics!
